# General terms and conditions
[[de](./Terms.md)|**en**]

## Legal relationship between user and operator of the software ubud
The provision of the software ubud is a free mere favour. Thus, no rights and obligations of the operator of the software ubud are established. The user, on the other hand, agrees to comply with the applicable laws. Prohibited usage activities are to be omitted.

## Disclaimer

### General
The operator excludes any liability. The user acknowledges that he downloads, installs and uses the software at his own discretion and risk.

### Plugins
When using the ubud software, you can install plugins to enable connection to various third-party services. These were developed by third parties or the user. With the installation the user agrees with the following:

- Third-party plugins and services are not checked, recommended or controlled by the operator of the ubud software.
- Any use of a third-party plug-in is at your own risk. The operator of the ubud software is not liable to third parties or the user in this respect.
- In the relationship between plugin developer and user, only the general terms and conditions of the operator of the software ubud apply.
- Some third-party services may request or demand access to your data. The privacy policy of the plugin developer applies. The operator of the software ubud has no control over how a third party uses your data.
- Third-party plug-ins may not work properly.
- In rare cases, the operator of the ubud software reserves the right to disable plug-ins that are already installed. This is done at its discretion, especially in the event of legal violations, security or privacy concerns.

## Disclaimer of Warranty
The operator excludes any liability for defects. Accordingly, there is also no claim to support. A complete and error-free use of the software ubud cannot be guaranteed.

## Requirements and duties of plugin developers
The provision of a plugin does not give rise to any claims whatsoever. Neither the user nor the operator of the software owes ubud a fee. The plugin developer has no claim to listing in the plugin directory.

The plugin developer is not allowed to provide the user with his own terms and conditions. The general terms and conditions of the operator of the software ubud also apply in the relationship between the plugin developer and the user.

Plugin developers are obliged to comply with the applicable legal data protection regulations and all other laws.

## Copyright
The software is protected by copyright. Copies are only allowed for backup purposes. Publication is expressly prohibited.

## Place of jurisdiction and choice of law
The place of jurisdiction shall be Tempelhof/Kreuzberg Local Court.

German law shall apply.

## Amendment of these General Terms and Conditions
Amendments to these GTC shall be presented to the user in text form on the graphical user interface at least 30 days before they take effect. In addition, the GTC can be downloaded from the ubud software website (https://ubud.club). The user's consent shall be deemed to have been granted if use is made over the 30-day period. An objection is not possible for technical reasons. If the user does not agree with the change to the GTC, only the uninstallation of the software remains for technical reasons.

## Translation
These Terms and Conditions were originally written in German. We have the right to translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the German version, the German version shall prevail.
